title: "Still"
description: "A minimal Zola theme for quiet writing."
---

**Still** is a minimal theme for Zola.

It is designed for writing that prefers clarity over decoration,
and reading that is calm, uninterrupted, and focused.

No sidebars.
No unnecessary navigation.
No visual noise.

---

### Writing comes first

This theme assumes:

* articles are meant to be read from start to finish
* links appear naturally *inside* the text
* the page should disappear while reading

Typography, spacing, and contrast are tuned to stay out of the way.

---

### What you will (not) find

* No hero images
* No cards, grids, or animations
* No social widgets
* No language switching logic

Just text, links, and whitespace.

---

### About the name

*Still* means:

* quiet
* unmoving
* focused

A page that does not compete with what you write.
